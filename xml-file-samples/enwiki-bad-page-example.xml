Following the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1922, Dublin became the capital of the [[Irish Free State]], later renamed Ireland.

Dublin is a historical and contemporary centre for education, the arts, administration and industry.  {{as of|2018}} the city was listed by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]] (GaWC) as a [[global city]], with a ranking of &quot;Alpha −&quot;, which places it amongst the top thirty cities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zyen.com/GFCI/GFCI%208.pdf |title=Global Financial Centres Index 8 |accessdate=30 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011091643/http://www.zyen.com/GFCI/GFCI%208.pdf |archive-date=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2018t.html |title= The World According to GaWC 2018 |publisher=Globalization and World Cities Research Network: [[Loughborough University]] |accessdate=23 November 2018 |date=13 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{See also|Names of European cities in different languages: C–D#D|l1=Other names of Dublin}}

The name ''Dublin'' derives from the Irish word ''Dubhlinn'', early [[Classical Gaelic|Classical Irish]] {{lang|ghc|Dubhlind}}/{{lang|ghc|Duibhlind}}, from {{lang|ghc|dubh}} ({{IPA-all|d̪uβ|}}, {{IPA-all|d̪uw|}}, {{IPA-all|d̪uː|}}) meaning &quot;black, dark&quot;, and {{lang|ghc|lind}} ({{IPA-all|lʲiɲ(d̪ʲ)|}}) &quot;pool&quot;, referring to a dark tidal pool. This tidal pool was located where the [[River Poddle]] entered the [[River Liffey|Liffey]], on the site of the castle gardens at the rear of [[Dublin Castle]]. In Modern Irish the name is ''Duibhlinn'', and Irish rhymes from County Dublin show that in Dublin [[Irish language#Leinster|Leinster Irish]] it was pronounced ''Duílinn'' {{IPA-ga|ˈd̪ˠiːlʲiɲ|}}. The original pronunciation is preserved in the names for the city in other languages such as [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|Di'''f'''elin}}, [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|Dy'''f'''lin}}, modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] {{lang|is|Dy'''f'''linn}} and modern [[Manx language|Manx]] {{lang|gv|Di'''v'''lyn}} as well as [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|Du'''lyn'''}}. Other localities in Ireland also bear the name ''Duibhlinn'', variously anglicised as Devlin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/en/14364 |title=Placenames Database of Ireland: Duibhlinn/Devlin |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divlin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/en/13534 |title=Placenames Database of Ireland: Béal Duibhlinne/Ballydivlin |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Difflin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/en/16486 |title=Placenames Database of Ireland: Duibhlinn/Difflin |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, scribes using the [[Insular script|Gaelic script]] wrote ''bh'' with a dot over the ''b'', rendering Duḃlinn or Duiḃlinn. Those without knowledge of Irish omitted the dot, spelling the name as ''Dublin''. Variations on the name are also found in traditionally Gaelic-speaking areas of [[Scotland]] ([[Gàidhealtachd]], cognate with Irish [[Gaeltacht]]), such as ''An Linne Dhubh'' (&quot;the black pool&quot;), which is part of [[Loch Linnhe]].

It is now thought that the Viking settlement was preceded by a Christian ecclesiastical settlement known as ''Duibhlinn'', from which ''Dyflin'' took its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Dublin, the making of a metropolis|last=Clarke|first=Howard|publisher=Irish Academic Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0716524595|location=|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 9th and 10th century, there were two settlements where the modern city stands. The Viking settlement of about 841, ''Dyflin'', and a Gaelic settlement, Áth Cliath (&quot;ford of hurdles&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Palgrave Handbook of Literature and the City|last=Tambling|first=Jeremy|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2017|isbn=978-1137549105|location=|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; further up river, at the present day [[Father Mathew Bridge]] (also known as Dublin Bridge), at the bottom of Church Street. ''{{lang|ga|Baile Átha Cliath}}'', meaning &quot;town of the hurdled [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]&quot;, is the common name for the city in modern Irish. ''{{lang|ga|Áth Cliath}}'' is a place name referring to a fording point of the River Liffey near Father Mathew Bridge. ''{{lang|ga|Baile Átha Cliath}}'' was an early Christian monastery, believed to have been in the area of Aungier Street, currently occupied by [[Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church]]. There are other towns of the same name, such as ''Àth Cliath'' in [[East Ayrshire]], Scotland, which is anglicised as [[Hurlford]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Dublin|Timeline of Dublin}}

The area of [[Dublin Bay]] has been inhabited by humans since prehistoric times, but the writings of [[Ptolemy]] (the Greco-Roman astronomer and [[cartographer]]) in about AD 140 provide possibly the earliest reference to a settlement there. He called it ''[[Eblana]] polis'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἔβλανα πόλις}}).&lt;ref name=Holder&gt;{{cite book |last=Holder |first=Alfred |date=1896 |title=Alt-celtischer sprachschatz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWg9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1393 |language=German |location=Leipzig |publisher=B.

Dublin celebrated its 'official' millennium in 1988, meaning the Irish government recognised 988 as the year in which the city was settled and that this first settlement would later become the city of Dublin.&lt;ref name=&quot;it1986&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2010/0108/1224261895496.html|title=From the Archives: 8 January 1986: 'Bogus' selection of date to mark Dublin's millennium|last=McDonald |first=Frank |date=8 January 2010 |work=[[Irish Times]] |accessdate=21 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish Academic Press. p. 44. {{ISBN|978-0716524595}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Viking settlement of about 841 was preceded by a Christian ecclesiastical settlement known as ''Duibhlinn'', from which ''Dyflin'' took its name. Beginning in the 9th and 10th century, there were two settlements which later became the modern Dublin. The subsequent Scandinavian settlement centred on the [[River Poddle]], a tributary of the Liffey in an area now known as [[Wood Quay]]. The Dubhlinn was a pool on the lowest stretch of the Poddle, used to moor ships. This pool was finally fully infilled during the early 18th century, as the city grew. The Dubhlinn lay where the Castle Garden is now located, opposite the [[Chester Beatty Library]] within [[Dublin Castle]]. ''[[Táin Bó Cuailgne]]'' (&quot;The Cattle Raid of Cooley&quot;) refers to ''Dublind rissa ratter Áth Cliath'', meaning &quot;Dublin, which is called Ath Cliath&quot;.

===Middle Ages===
Dublin was established as a [[Viking]] settlement in the 10th century and, despite a number of attacks by the native Irish, it remained largely under Viking control until the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] was launched from Wales in 1169.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Norman | authorlink = Norman Davies | title = The Isles: a history | publisher=Macmillan | year = 1999 | location = London | page = 1222 | isbn = 978-0-333-76370-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was upon the death of [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn]] in early 1166 that [[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair]], [[King of Connacht]], proceeded to Dublin and was inaugurated ''King of Ireland'' without opposition.

According to some historians, part of the city's early economic growth is attributed to a trade in slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;dickson10&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title= Dublin The Making of a Capital City|last=Dickson|first=David|publisher=Profile Books Ltd.|year=2014|isbn=978-0-674-74444-8|location=|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavery in Ireland]] and Dublin reached its pinnacle in the 9th and 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title= The Slave Trade of Dublin, Ninth To Twelfth Centuries|last=Holm|first=Poul|journal=[[Peritia]]|publisher=Journal of the Medieval Journal of Ireland|year=1989|pages=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners from slave raids and kidnappings, which captured men, women and children, brought revenue to the Gaelic Irish Sea raiders, as well as to the Vikings who had initiated the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title= The Slave Trade of Dublin, Ninth To Twelfth Centuries|last=Holm|first=Poul|journal=[[Peritia]]|publisher=Journal of the Medieval Journal of Ireland|year=1989|page=335|quote = the very idea of the taking of prisoners of war spread to the Irish [from the Vikings] in the tenth century}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims came from [[Wales]], England, Normandy and beyond.&lt;ref name=&quot;dickson10&quot;/&gt;

The King of Leinster, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], after his exile by Ruaidhrí, enlisted the help of [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]], the Earl of Pembroke, to conquer Dublin. Following Mac Murrough's death, Strongbow declared himself King of Leinster after gaining control of the city. In response to Strongbow's successful invasion, King [[Henry II of England]] affirmed his ultimate sovereignty by mounting a larger invasion in 1171 and pronounced himself Lord of Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dublin.info&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublin.info/history|title=A Brief History of Dublin, Ireland|publisher=Dublin.info|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, the ''county of the City of Dublin'' was established along with certain liberties adjacent to the city proper. This continued down to 1840 when the [[Barony (Ireland)|barony]] of Dublin City was separated from the [[Dublin (barony)|barony of Dublin]]. Since 2001, both baronies have been redesignated as the ''City of Dublin''.

[[File:The Dubhlinn Gardens Dublin Castle 01.JPG|thumb|[[Dublin Castle]], with its 13th-century tower, was the fortified seat of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British rule]] in Ireland until 1922.]]
[[Dublin Castle]], which became the centre of Norman power in Ireland, was founded in 1204 as a major defensive work on the orders of King [[John of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Fitzhenry, Meiler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the appointment of the first [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]] in 1229, the city expanded and had a population of 8,000 by the end of the 13th century. Dublin prospered as a trade centre, despite an attempt by King [[Robert I of Scotland]] to capture the city in 1317.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dublin.info&quot;/&gt; It remained a relatively small walled medieval town during the 14th century and was under constant threat from the surrounding native clans. In 1348, the [[Black Death]], a lethal plague which had ravaged Europe, took hold in Dublin and killed thousands over the following decade.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R688at3KskQC&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage The Story of Ireland]''&quot;.

Joseph Patrick Byrne (2004). p.58. {{ISBN|0-313-32492-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dublin was incorporated into the [[English Crown]] as [[the Pale]], which was a narrow strip of English settlement along the eastern seaboard. The [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] in the 16th century spelt a new era for Dublin, with the city enjoying a renewed prominence as the centre of administrative rule in Ireland. Determined to make Dublin a Protestant city, Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] established [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in 1592 as a solely Protestant university and ordered that the Catholic [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] cathedrals be converted to Protestant.

The city had a population of 21,000 in 1640 before a plague in 1649–51 wiped out almost half of the city's inhabitants. However, the city prospered again soon after as a result of the wool and linen trade with England, reaching a population of over 50,000 in 1700.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gI8MYY6ASdcC&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage Dublin: a cultural history]''&quot;.

===Early modern===
[[File:HENRIETTA STREET - DUBLIN (402556531).jpg|thumb|[[Henrietta Street, Dublin|Henrietta Street]], developed in the 1720s is the earliest [[Georgian Dublin|Georgian street]] in Dublin.]]

As the city continued to prosper during the 18th century, [[Georgian Dublin]] became, for a short period, the second largest city of the [[British Empire]] and the fifth largest city in Europe, with the population exceeding 130,000. The vast majority of Dublin's most notable architecture dates from this period – the [[Four Courts]], [[the Custom House]], [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] and [[Grafton Street]] are some of the few remaining areas that were not affected by the wave of Georgian reconstruction and maintained their medieval character.{{cn|date=August 2019}}

Dublin grew even more dramatically during the 18th century, with the construction of many new districts and buildings, such as [[Merrion Square]], [[Irish Houses of Parliament|Parliament House]] and the [[City Hall, Dublin|Royal Exchange]]. The [[Wide Streets Commission]] was established in 1757 at the request of [[Dublin Corporation]] to govern architectural standards on the layout of streets, bridges and buildings. In 1759, the [[Guinness brewery]] was founded; and would eventually grow to become the largest brewery in the world and the largest employer in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=b-tFDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT12&amp;dq=guinness+%22largest+employer%22#v=onepage&amp;q=guinness%20%22largest%20employer%22 | publisher =  Collins Press | title = Stones of Dublin | author = Lisa Marie Griffith | date = 2014 | page = | quote = ''[Guinness] was Dublin's largest brewery in 1810, Ireland's largest in 1833, and the largest in the world by 1914.

===Late modern and contemporary===
[[File:General Post Office Dublin 20060803.jpg|thumb|[[General Post Office (Dublin)|The GPO]] on [[O'Connell Street]] was at the centre of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].]]
Dublin suffered a period of political and economic decline during the 19th century following the [[Acts of Union 1800]], under which the seat of government was transferred to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]] in London. The city played no major role in the [[Industrial Revolution]], but remained the centre of administration and a transport hub for most of the island. Ireland had no significant sources of coal, the fuel of the time, and Dublin was not a centre of ship manufacturing, the other main driver of industrial development in Britain and Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt; [[Belfast]] developed faster than Dublin during this period on a mixture of international trade, factory-based linen cloth production and shipbuilding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Lyons | first = F.S.L. | authorlink = F.S.L.

[[File:Life goes on... (6937669789).jpg|thumb|Damage in Dublin city centre following the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] with the ruins of the GPO to the left]]
The [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, the [[Irish War of Independence]], and the subsequent [[Irish Civil War]] resulted in a significant amount of physical destruction in central Dublin. The [[Government of the Irish Free State]] rebuilt the city centre and located the new parliament, the [[Oireachtas]], in [[Leinster House]]. Since the beginning of [[Normans|Norman]] rule in the 12th century, the city has functioned as the capital in varying geopolitical entities: [[Lordship of Ireland]] (1171–1541), [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1541–1800), as part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (1801–1922), and the [[Irish Republic]] (1919–1922). Following the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1922, it became the capital of the [[Irish Free State]] (1922–1937) and now is the capital of Ireland. One of the memorials to commemorate that time is the [[Garden of Remembrance (Dublin)|Garden of Remembrance]].

Dublin was also a victim of the Northern Irish [[The Troubles|Troubles]], although during this 30-year conflict, violence mainly occurred within Northern Ireland. However, the [[Provisional IRA]] drew some support from within the Republic, including from Dublin. A Loyalist paramilitary group, the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]], bombed the city during this time – notably in an atrocity known as the [[Dublin and Monaghan bombings]] in which 34 people died, mainly in central Dublin.

Since 1997, the landscape of Dublin has changed. The city was at the forefront of Ireland's economic expansion during the [[Celtic Tiger]] period, with private sector and state development of housing, transport and business. Following an economic decline during the Great Recession, Dublin has rebounded and {{as of|2017|lc=y}} has close to full employment,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://issuu.com/256media/docs/dublineconomicmonitor_oct2017?e=16581915/54602478|title=Dublin Economic Monitor – October 2017|work=issuu|access-date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a significant problem with housing supply in both city and surrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/construction-of-homes-in-dublin-city-halves-1.3737361 | title = Construction of homes in Dublin city halves | author = Olivia Kelly | date = 19 December 2018 | work = The Irish Times | quote = ''The number of homes under construction in Dublin city is down almost 50 per cent on last year, with a 20 per cent drop across the region as a whole, according to a new report from the Government's Dublin Housing Supply Task Force''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local===
[[File:Dublin City Council Civic Offices.JPG|thumb|Civic Offices of [[Dublin City Council]]]]
From 1842, the boundaries of the city were comprehended by the [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of Dublin City and the [[Barony of Dublin]]. In 1930, the boundaries were extended by the Local Government (Dublin) Act.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irish Statute Book]]. [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1930/en/act/pub/0027/sched1.html#sched1 Local Government (Dublin) Act]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1953, the boundaries were again extended by the Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1953/en/act/prv/0001/print.html |title=Irish statute book, Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Act, 1953 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=28 March 1953 |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dublin City Council]] is a [[unicameral]] assembly of 63&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/main-menu-your-council/local-elections|title=Local Elections 2014|website=Dublin City Council|accessdate=13 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715001530/http://www.dublincity.ie/main-menu-your-council/local-elections|archivedate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; members elected every five years from [[Local Electoral Area|Local Election Areas]]. It is presided over by the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin|Lord Mayor]], who is elected for a yearly term and resides in Dublin's [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]]. Council meetings occur at [[Dublin City Hall]], while most of its administrative activities are based in the Civic Offices on [[Wood Quay]]. The party or coalition of parties with the majority of seats assigns committee members, introduces policies, and proposes the Lord Mayor. The Council passes an annual budget for spending on areas such as housing, traffic management, refuse, drainage, and planning. The Dublin City Manager is responsible for implementing City Council decisions but also has considerable executive power.

===National===
[[File:20130810 dublin214.JPG|right|thumb|[[Leinster House]] on Kildare Street houses the [[Oireachtas]].]]
As the capital city, Dublin is the seat of the national parliament of Ireland, the [[Oireachtas]]. It is composed of the [[President of Ireland]], [[Seanad Éireann]] as the upper house, and [[Dáil Éireann]] as the lower house. The President resides in [[Áras an Uachtaráin]] in [[Phoenix Park]], while both houses of the Oireachtas meet in [[Leinster House]], a former ducal palace on [[Kildare Street]]. It has been the home of the Irish parliament since the creation of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922. The old [[Irish Houses of Parliament]] of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] are located in [[College Green, Dublin|College Green]].

[[Government Buildings]] house the [[Department of the Taoiseach]], the Council Chamber, the Department of Finance and the [[Attorney General of Ireland|Office of the Attorney General]]. It consists of a main building (completed 1911) with two wings (completed 1921). It was designed by Thomas Manley Dean and Sir [[Aston Webb]] as the [[Royal College of Science (Ireland)|Royal College of Science]]. The [[First Dáil]] originally met in the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]] in 1919. The Irish Free State government took over the two wings of the building to serve as a temporary home for some ministries, while the central building became the College of Technology until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Taoiseach: Guide to Government Buildings (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Although both it and Leinster House were intended to be temporary locations, they became the permanent homes of parliament from then on.

For elections to [[Dáil Éireann]], the city is divided into five constituencies: [[Dublin Central (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Central]] (3 seats), [[Dublin Bay North (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Bay North]] (5 seats), [[Dublin North-West (Dáil constituency)|Dublin North-West]] (3 seats), [[Dublin South-Central (Dáil constituency)|Dublin South-Central]] (4 seats) and [[Dublin Bay South (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Bay South]] (4 seats).

==Geography==
===Landscape===
[[File:Dublin SPOT 1023.jpg|thumb|Satellite image showing the [[River Liffey]] entering the [[Irish Sea]] as it divides Dublin into the [[Northside (Dublin)|Northside]] and the [[Southside (Dublin)|Southside]]]]
Dublin is situated at the mouth of the [[River Liffey]] and encompasses a land area of approximately {{convert|115|km2}} in east-central Ireland. It is bordered by the Dublin Mountains, a low mountain range and sub range of the [[Wicklow Mountains]], to the south and surrounded by flat farmland to the north and west.&lt;ref name=&quot;Facts about Dublin&quot;/&gt;

====Watercourses====
{{see also|List of rivers of County Dublin}}
The River Liffey divides the city in two, between the Northside and the Southside. The Liffey bends at [[Leixlip]] from a northeasterly route to a predominantly eastward direction, and this point also marks the transition to urban development from more agricultural land usage.&lt;ref name=&quot;erdb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Final Characterisation Report  |url= http://erbd.ie/upload/files/Characterisation%20Report.pdf  |publisher=Eastern River Basin District  |at=Sec. 7: Characterisation of the Liffey Catchment Area | accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two secondary rivers further divide the city &amp;nbsp;– the [[River Tolka]], running southeast into Dublin Bay, and the [[River Dodder]] running northeast to near the mouth of the Liffey, and these and the Liffey have multiple tributaries. A number of lesser rivers and streams also flow to the sea.

Two canals&amp;nbsp;– the [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]] on the southside and the [[Royal Canal of Ireland|Royal Canal]] on the northside&amp;nbsp;– ring the inner city on their way from the west and the [[River Shannon]].

===Cultural divide===

Similar to much of the rest of northwestern Europe, Dublin experiences a [[maritime climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|''Cfb'']]) with cool summers, mild winters, and a lack of temperature extremes. The average maximum January temperature is {{convert|8.8|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while the average maximum July temperature is {{convert|20.2|°C|0|abbr=on}}. On average, the sunniest months are May and June, while the wettest month is October with {{convert|76|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain, and the driest month is February with {{convert|46|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year.

Dublin's sheltered location on the east coast makes it the driest place in Ireland, receiving only about half the rainfall of the west coast. [[Ringsend]] in the south of the city records the lowest rainfall in the country, with an average annual precipitation of {{convert|683|mm|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=European Climate Assessment &amp; Dataset |title=Climatology details for station DUBLIN (RINGSEND), IRELAND and index RR: Precipitation sum |url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&amp;periodid=1981-2010&amp;indexid=RR&amp;stationid=1958 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the average annual precipitation in the city centre being {{convert|714|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The main precipitation in winter is rain; however snow showers do occur between November and March. Hail is more common than snow. The city experiences long summer days and short winter days. Strong Atlantic winds are most common in autumn. These winds can affect Dublin, but due to its easterly location, it is least affected compared to other parts of the country. However, in winter, easterly winds render the city colder and more prone to snow showers.

In the 20th century, smog and air-pollution were an issue in the city, precipitating a ban on bituminous fuels across Dublin.&lt;ref name=&quot;coalbangov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/environment/topics/air-quality/smoky-coal-ban/Pages/default.aspx | publisher = Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment | title = Smoky coal ban | accessdate = 1 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;coalbantimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/how-the-coal-ban-dealt-with-dublin-s-burning-issue-1.2367021 | work = The Irish Times | title = How the coal ban dealt with Dublin's burning issue | date= 26 September 2015 |accessdate = 22 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was implemented in 1990 to address black smoke concentrations, that had been linked to cardiovascular and respiratory deaths in residents.

===Landmarks===
{{Further|List of public art in Dublin}}
Dublin has many landmarks and monuments dating back hundreds of years. One of the oldest is [[Dublin Castle]], which was first founded as a major defensive work on the orders of England's [[John, King of England|King John]] in 1204, shortly after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169, when it was commanded that a castle be built with strong walls and good ditches for the defence of the city, the administration of justice, and the protection of the King's treasure.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book|last= McCarthy|first= Denis |author2=Benton, David |year= 2004|title= Dublin Castle: at the heart of Irish History|location= Dublin|publisher=Irish Government Stationery Office |pages= 12–18|isbn= 978-0-7557-1975-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Largely complete by 1230, the castle was of typical Norman courtyard design, with a central square without a [[keep]], bounded on all sides by tall defensive walls and protected at each corner by a circular tower. Sited to the south-east of Norman Dublin, the castle formed one corner of the outer perimeter of the city, using the [[River Poddle]] as a natural means of defence.

[[File:O'Connell Street Dublin &amp; Jim Larkin.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Spire of Dublin]] rises behind the statue of [[James Larkin|Jim Larkin]]]]
One of Dublin's newest monuments is the [[Spire of Dublin]], officially entitled the &quot;Monument of Light.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a {{convert|121.2|m|ft|adj=on}} conical spire made of stainless steel, located on [[O'Connell Street]] where it meets Henry Street and North Earl Street. It replaces [[Nelson's Pillar]] and is intended to mark Dublin's place in the 21st century. The spire was designed by [[Ian Ritchie Architects]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiseek.com/2010/2003-the-dublin-spire-oconnell-street-dublin/ |title=The Dublin Spire |publisher=Archiseek |year=2003 |accessdate=20 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110210127/http://archiseek.com/2010/2003-the-dublin-spire-oconnell-street-dublin/ |archive-date=10 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; who sought an &quot;Elegant and dynamic simplicity bridging art and technology&quot;. The base of the monument is lit and the top is illuminated to provide a beacon in the night sky across the city.

The Old Library of [[Trinity College, Dublin]], holding the [[Book of Kells]], is one of the city's most visited sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/business/transport-and-tourism/guinness-storehouse-tops-list-of-most-visited-attractions-1.1476060 | work = The Irish Times | title = Guinness Storehouse tops list of most visited attractions | date= 26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Kells is an illustrated manuscript created by Irish monks circa 800 AD. The [[Ha'penny Bridge]], an iron footbridge over the River Liffey, is one of the most photographed sights in Dublin and is considered to be one of Dublin's most iconic landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.traveldir.org/articles/europe/ireland/dublin/some_famous_landmarks_of_dublin.html |title=Some Famous Landmarks of Dublin&amp;nbsp;– Dublin Hotels &amp; Travel Guide |publisher=Traveldir.org |date=8 March 1966 |accessdate=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912062428/http://www.traveldir.org/articles/europe/ireland/dublin/some_famous_landmarks_of_dublin.html |archive-date=12 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other landmarks and monuments include [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]] and [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]], the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]], the [[Molly Malone]] statue, the complex of buildings around Leinster House, including part of the [[National Museum of Ireland]] and the [[National Library of Ireland]], [[The Custom House]] and [[Áras an Uachtaráin]]. Other sights include the [[Anna Livia (monument)|Anna Livia monument]].  The [[Poolbeg Generating Station|Poolbeg Towers]] are also landmark features of Dublin, and visible from various spots around the city.

===Parks===
[[File:Dublin Stephen's Green-44 edit.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[St Stephen's Green]]]]
There are many green-spaces around the city, and Dublin City Council manages over {{convert|1500|ha|acre}} of parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/main-menu-services-recreation-culture/dublin-city-parks|title=Dublin City Parks |publisher=[[Dublin City Council]] |accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public parks include the [[Phoenix Park]], [[Herbert Park]], [[St Stephen's Green]], [[Saint Anne's Park]] and [[Bull Island]]. The Phoenix Park is about {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=in}} west of the city centre, north of the [[River Liffey]]. Its {{convert|16|km|0|adj=on}} perimeter wall encloses {{convert|707|ha|acre}}, making it one of the largest walled city parks in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;It is larger than all of London's city parks put together, and more than twice the area of New York's Central Park. {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes large areas of grassland and tree-lined avenues, and since the 17th century has been home to a herd of wild [[fallow deer]]. The residence of the [[President of Ireland]] (Áras an Uachtaráin), which was built in 1751,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outline History of Áras an Uachtaráin|url=http://www.president.ie/en/explore-visit/the-house|website=Áras an Uachtaráin|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is located in the park. The park is also home to [[Dublin Zoo]], [[Ashtown Castle]], and the official residence of the [[United States Ambassador to Ireland|United States Ambassador]]. Music concerts are also sometimes held in the park.

St Stephen's Green is adjacent to one of Dublin's main shopping streets, [[Grafton Street, Dublin|Grafton Street]], and to [[Stephen's Green Shopping Centre|a shopping centre named for it]], while on its surrounding streets are the offices of a number of public bodies.

[[Saint Anne's Park]] is a public park and recreational facility, shared between [[Raheny]] and [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]], both suburbs on the Northside. The park, the second largest municipal park in Dublin, is part of a former {{convert|2|km²|sqmi acre|sigfig=1|adj=on}} estate assembled by members of the [[Guinness family]], beginning with [[Benjamin Lee Guinness]] in 1835 (the largest municipal park is nearby (North) [[Bull Island]], also shared between Clontarf and Raheny), featuring a 5&amp;nbsp;km beach.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Dublin}}

[[File:The Ulster Bank Group HQ, George's Quay Plaza - geograph.org.uk - 1743476.jpg|thumb|[[Ulster Bank]] on [[George's Quay Plaza]]]] The Dublin region is the economic centre of Ireland, and was at the forefront of the country's economic expansion during the [[Celtic Tiger]] period. In 2009, Dublin was listed as the fourth richest city in the world by [[purchasing power]] and 10th richest by personal income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/economics/usb-purchasing-power.html |title=Richest cities in the world by purchasing power in 2009 |publisher=City Mayors |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/economics/richest_cities.html |title=Richest cities in the world by personal earnings in 2009 |publisher=Citymayors.com |date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Mercer's 2011 Worldwide Cost of Living Survey'', Dublin is the 13th most expensive city in the [[European Union]] (down from 10th in 2010) and the 58th most expensive place to live in the world (down from 42nd in 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/dublin-falls-in-city-cost-rankings-1.879923|title=Dublin falls in city-cost rankings |work=The Irish Times |date=12 July 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017}}, approximately 874,400 people were employed in the Greater Dublin Area. Around 60% of people who are employed in Ireland's financial, ICT, and professional sectors are located in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dublinchamber.ie/business-agenda/about-dublin|title=About Dublin. Economic Activity, Tax &amp; Employment|website=Dublin Chamber|access-date=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Dublin's traditional industries, such as food processing, textile manufacturing, brewing, and distilling have gradually declined, although [[Guinness]] has been brewed at the [[St. James's Gate Brewery]] since 1759. Economic improvements in the 1990s attracted a number of global pharmaceutical, information and communications technology companies to the city and [[Greater Dublin Area]]. Companies such as [[Microsoft]], Google, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[eBay]], [[PayPal]], [[Yahoo!]], Facebook, Twitter, [[Accenture]] and [[Pfizer]] now have European headquarters and/or operational bases in the city, with several located in enterprise clusters like the [[The Digital Hub|Digital Hub]] and [[Silicon Docks]]. The presence of these companies has driven economic expansion in the city and led to Dublin sometimes being referred to as the &quot;Tech Capital of Europe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Financial services have also become important to the city since the establishment of Dublin's [[International Financial Services Centre]] in 1987. More than 500 operations are approved to trade under the IFSC programme. The centre is host to half of the world's top 50 banks and to half of the top 20 insurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ifsc.ie/page.aspx?idpage=6|title=I.F.S.C |publisher=I.F.S.C.ie |date= 21 June 2010 |accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many international firms have established major headquarters in the city, such as [[Citibank]]. The [[Irish Stock Exchange]] (ISEQ), [[Internet Neutral Exchange]] (INEX) and Irish Enterprise Exchange (IEX) are also located in Dublin. Dublin has been positioned as one of the main cities vying to host Financial Services companies hoping to retain access to the Eurozone after [[Brexit]]. The Celtic Tiger also led to a temporary boom in construction, with large redevelopment projects in the [[Dublin Docklands]] and [[Spencer Dock]]. Completed projects include the [[Convention Centre Dublin|Convention Centre]], the [[3Arena]], and the [[Bord Gáis Energy Theatre]].

In the second quarter of 2018, Dublin touched its lowest unemployment rate in a decade, when it fell down to 5.7% as reported by the Dublin Economic Monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/business/monitor-dublin-unemployment-falls-to-lowest-level-in-10-years-amid-economic-resurgence-859553.html|title=Monitor: Dublin unemployment falls to lowest level in 10 years amid economic resurgence|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/256media/docs/dem_aug18?e=16581915/63526870|title=14th issue of the Dublin Economic Monitor|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Dublin}}

===Road===
[[File:DublinM50.png|thumb|The [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50 motorway]] surrounding Dublin]]
The road network in Ireland is primarily focused on Dublin. The [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50 motorway]], a semi-[[ring road]] which runs around the south, west and north of the city, connects important national primary routes to the rest of the country. In 2008, the [[West-Link]] toll bridge was replaced by the [[eFlow]] barrier-free tolling system, with a three-tiered charge system based on electronic tags and car pre-registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = EFlow Website | publisher=eFlow | url = http://eflow.ie/| accessdate =29 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first phase of a proposed eastern bypass for the city is the [[Dublin Port Tunnel]], which officially opened in 2006 to mainly cater for heavy vehicles. The tunnel connects [[Dublin Port]] and the [[M1 motorway (Republic of Ireland)|M1 motorway]] close to Dublin Airport. The city is also surrounded by an inner and outer orbital route. The inner orbital route runs approximately around the heart of the Georgian city and the outer orbital route runs primarily along the natural circle formed by Dublin's two canals, the [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]] and the [[Royal Canal of Ireland|Royal Canal]], as well as the North and South Circular Roads.

The 2016 [[TomTom]] Traffic Index ranked Dublin the 15th most congested city in the world and the 7th most congested in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelpie|first1=Colm|title=Revealed: Dublin ranked worse than London or Paris for road congestion|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/revealed-dublin-ranked-worse-than-london-or-paris-for-road-congestion-34563994.html|accessdate=20 December 2016|work=The Irish Independent|date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TomTom Traffic Index|url=https://www.tomtom.com/en_ie/trafficindex/list|website=TomTom|accessdate=20 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329034844/http://tomtom.com/en_ie/trafficindex/list|archive-date=29 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bus====
Dublin is served by a network of nearly 200 bus routes which cover the city and suburbs. The majority of these are provided by [[Dublin Bus]], with a modest number having been transferred to Go Ahead Ireland in 2018, but a number of smaller companies also operate. Fares are generally calculated on a stage system based on distance travelled. There are several different levels of fares, which apply on most services. A &quot;Real Time Passenger Information&quot; system was introduced at Dublin Bus bus stops in 2012. Electronically displayed signs relay information about the time of the next bus' arrival based on its GPS determined position. The [[National Transport Authority (Ireland)|National Transport Authority]] is responsible for integration of bus and rail services in Dublin and has been involved in introducing a pre-paid smart card, called a [[Leap card]], which can be used on all of Dublin's public transport services.

====Cycling====
The 2011 Census showed that 5.9 percent of commuters in Dublin cycled. A 2013 report by Dublin City Council on traffic flows crossing the canals in and out of the city found that just under 10% of all traffic was made up of cyclists, representing an increase of 14.1% over 2012 and an 87.2% increase over 2006 levels and is attributed to measures, such as, the Dublinbikes bike rental scheme, the provision of cycle lanes, public awareness campaigns to promote cycling and the introduction of the 30 km/h city centre speed limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/content//RoadsandTraffic/Traffic/Documents/Canal_Cordon_Counts_2013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903221013/http://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/content//RoadsandTraffic/Traffic/Documents/Canal_Cordon_Counts_2013.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 September 2015 |title=Report on trends in mode share of vehicles and people crossing the Canal Cordon 2006 to 2013 |year=2013 |publisher=[[Dublin City Council]] &amp; National Transport Authority |pages=4, 8, 16 |accessdate=29 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dublin City Council began installing cycle lanes and tracks throughout the city in the 1990s, and {{as of|2012|lc=y}} the city had over {{convert|200|km|miles}} of specific on- and off-road tracks for cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cycledublin.ie/category/cycling-maps|title=Cycling Maps|publisher=Dublincitycycling.ie|accessdate=13 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620073156/http://www.cycledublin.ie/category/cycling-maps|archive-date=20 June 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the city was ranked 9th of major world cities on the ''Copenhagenize Index of Bicycle-Friendly Cities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copenhagenize.eu/index/index.html |title=Copenhagenize Consulting – ''Copenhagenize Index of Bicycle-Friendly Cities 2011'' |publisher=Copenhagenize.eu |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same index showed a fall to 15th in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copenhagenize.eu/index/index.html |title=Copenhagenize Consulting – ''Copenhagenize Index of Bicycle-Friendly Cities 2011'' |publisher=Copenhagenize.eu |accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dublin was outside the top 20 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copenhagenize.eu/index/index.html |title=Copenhagenize Consulting – ''Copenhagenize Index of Bicycle-Friendly Cities 2017'' |publisher=Copenhagenize.eu |accessdate=12 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rail===
[[File:LUAS trams at Tallacht terminus. - geograph.org.uk - 1387090.jpg|thumb|[[Luas]] trams at the [[Tallaght]] terminus]]
[[Dublin Heuston railway station|Heuston]] and [[Dublin Connolly railway station|Connolly]] stations are the two main railway termini in Dublin. Operated by [[Iarnród Éireann]], the [[Dublin Suburban Rail]] network consists of five railway lines serving the Greater Dublin Area and commuter towns such as [[Drogheda]] and [[Dundalk]] in County Louth, Gorey in [[County Wexford]], and extending as far as [[Portlaoise]] and once a day, [[Newry]]. One of the five lines is the electrified [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) line, which runs primarily along the coast of Dublin, comprising 31 stations, from [[Malahide]] and [[Howth]] southwards as far as [[Greystones]] in County Wicklow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublin.ie/transport/dart.htm|title=DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit)|accessdate=28 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721123858/http://www.dublin.ie/transport/dart.htm|archive-date=21 July 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Commuter (Irish Rail)|Commuter rail]] operates on the other four lines using Irish Rail [[diesel multiple unit]]s. In 2013, passengers for DART and Dublin Suburban lines were 16 million and 11.7&amp;nbsp;million, respectively (around 75% of all Irish Rail passengers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=TCA01|title=Passenger Journeys by Rail by Type of Journey and Year – StatBank – data and statistics|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dublin once had an extensive system of [[Dublin tramways|trams]] but this was largely phased out by 1949.  A new [[light rail]] system, often described as a tram system, the [[Luas]], was launched in 2004, and is run by [[Transdev]] Ireland (under contract from [[Transport Infrastructure Ireland]]), carrying over 34 million passengers annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luas - Frequently Asked Questions&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.luas.ie/faq.html|title=Luas – Frequently Asked Questions|website=luas.ie|access-date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network consists of two interconnecting lines; the [[Red Line (Luas)|Red Line]] links the [[Dublin Docklands|Docklands]] and city centre with the south-western suburbs of Tallaght and Saggart, while the [[Green Line (Luas)|Green Line]] connects northern inner city suburbs and the main city centre with suburbs to the south of the city including Sandyford and Brides Glen. Together these lines comprise a total 67 stations and {{convert|44.5|km|mi}} of track.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luas - Frequently Asked Questions&quot;/&gt; Construction of a 6&amp;nbsp;km extension to the Green Line, bringing it into the north of the city, commenced in June 2013 and was opened for passenger travel on 9 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://luas.ie/luas-cross-city-opening-2pm-sat-9th-dec/|title=Luas Cross City Opened|date=December 2017|website=Luas.ie|publisher=[[Transdev]]|accessdate=14 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215110751/https://luas.ie/luas-cross-city-opening-2pm-sat-9th-dec/|archive-date=15 December 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Rapid transit|metro]] service is proposed under the name of [[Dublin Metro|Metrolink]], and planned to run from Dublin's [[Northside, Dublin|northside]] to [[Sandyford]] via [[Dublin Airport]] and [[St. Stephen's Green]], with construction projected to start after 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/revealed-preferred-route-for-3bn-metrolink-from-city-centre-to-dublin-airport-unveiled-36732780.html|title=Revealed: Preferred route for €3bn MetroLink from city centre to Dublin Airport unveiled|last=Melia|first=Paul|date=22 March 2018|work=Irish Independent|access-date=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rail and ferry===
[[Dublin Connolly]] is connected by bus to [[Dublin Port]] and ferries run by [[Irish Ferries]] and [[Stena Line]] to [[Holyhead railway station|Holyhead]] for connecting trains on the [[North Wales Coast Line]] to [[Chester railway station|Chester]], [[Crewe railway station|Crewe]] and [[Euston railway station|London Euston]]. [[Dublin Connolly]] to Dublin Port can be reached via [[Amiens Street, Dublin]] into [[Store Street]] or by Luas via [[Busáras]] where [[Dublin Bus]] operates services to the Ferry Terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/Your-Journey1/Timetables/All-Timetables/53/|title=53 – Dublin Bus|website=dublinbus.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dublin Airport====
[[File:Dublinairport-terminal2.jpg|thumb|[[Dublin Airport]]]]
[[Dublin Airport]] (owned and operated by [[DAA (Irish company)|DAA]]) is located north of Dublin city, near [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]] in the administrative county of [[Fingal]]. The headquarters of Ireland's flag carrier [[Aer Lingus]] and regional airlines [[Stobart Air]] and [[CityJet]] are located there, and those of low-cost carrier [[Ryanair]] nearby. The airport offers a short and medium haul network, domestic services to regional airports in Ireland, and long-haul services to the United States, Canada, the Middle East and Hong Kong. Dublin Airport is the 11th busiest in the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.daa.ie/annual-report-2017/2017-at-a-glance/|title=2017 Year in Review|website=Dublin Airport|access-date=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by far the busiest airport on the island of Ireland.

In 2014, Dublin Airport was the 18th busiest airport in Europe, serving over 21 million passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bodkin|first1=Peter|title=Take a look inside the 10 busiest airports in Europe|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/busiest-airports-europe-2375524-Oct2015/|website=TheJournal.ie|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016 this increased to 27.9&amp;nbsp;million passengers passing through the airport, establishing an all-time record supported by growth in both short- and long-haul networks.&lt;ref name=&quot;dub2016record&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Record 2016 For Dublin Airport With Almost 28M Passengers|url=https://www.dublinairport.com/latest-news/detail/record-2016-for-dublin-airport-with-almost-28m-passengers|website=dublinairport.com |accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 and 2016, transatlantic traffic grew, with 158 summer flights a week to North America, making it the sixth largest European hub for that route over the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dublin Airport flying high after record year for transatlantic traffic – Independent.ie|url=http://www.independent.ie/life/travel/travel-news/dublin-airport-flying-high-after-record-year-for-transatlantic-traffic-30900426.html|website=The Irish Independent|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transatlantic traffic was also the fastest-growing segment of the market for the airport in 2016, in which a 16% increase from 2015 brought the yearly number of passengers travelling between Dublin and North America to 2.9&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;dub2016record&quot;/&gt;

From 2010 to 2016, Dublin Airport saw an increase of nearly 9.5&amp;nbsp;million passengers in its annual traffic,&lt;ref name=&quot;dub2016record&quot;/&gt; as the number of commercial aircraft movements has similarly followed a growth trend from 163,703 in 2013 to 191,233 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flight Statistics 1998 – 2014|url=https://www.iaa.ie/who-we-are/flight-statistics/flight-statistics-1998---2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411220834/https://www.iaa.ie/who-we-are/flight-statistics/flight-statistics-1998---2014|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 April 2016|website=Irish Aviation Authority|accessdate=1 February 2017|date=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Dublin]] is the oldest university in Ireland, dating from the 16th century, and is located in the city centre. Its sole constituent college, [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] (TCD), was established by [[Royal Charter]] in 1592 under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. It was closed to Roman Catholics until 1793, and the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|Catholic hierarchy]] then banned Roman Catholics from attending until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.tcd.ie/about/history/ | website = tcd.ie | publisher = Trinity College Dublin | title = History – About Trinity | accessdate = 9 July 2019 | quote = ''Catholics were permitted to enter and take degrees from 1793 [..followed by..] the removal of the Catholic episcopal 'ban' (in 1970)''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated in the city centre, on College Green, and has over 18,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hea.ie/assets/uploads/2017/04/TCD-Profile-2016.pdf|title=Trinity College Dublin Profile 2016/17|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Higher Education Authority|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National University of Ireland]] (NUI) has its seat in Dublin, which is also the location of the associated ''constituent university'' of [[University College Dublin]] (UCD), which has over 30,000 students. Founded in 1854, it is now the largest university in Ireland. UCD's main campus is at Belfield, about {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city centre, in the southeastern suburbs.

As of 2019, Dublin's principal, and Ireland's largest, institution for technological education and research, [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] (DIT), with origins in 1887, has merged with two major suburban third level institutions, [[Institute of Technology, Tallaght]] and [[Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown]], to form [[Technological University Dublin]], Ireland's second largest university by student population.  The new university offers a wide range of courses in areas include engineering, architecture, the sciences, health, journalism, digital media, hospitality, business, art and design, music and the humanities programmes, and has three long-term campuses, at [[Grangegorman]], Tallaght and Blanchardstown.

It has around 16,000 students, and its main campus is located about {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city centre, in the northern suburbs. Aside from the main Glasnevin Campus, the Drumcondra campus includes the former St Patrick's College of Education, now also hosting students from the nearby Mater Dei Institute and students from the Church of Ireland College of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dcuincorporation.ie |title=DCU incorporation of CICE, St Pats and Mater Dei |publisher=DCU |year=2014 |access-date=5 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418005013/https://dcuincorporation.ie/ |archive-date=18 April 2016 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] (RCSI) conducts a medical school which is a recognised college of the NUI, and is situated at [[St. Stephen's Green]] in the city centre; there are also large medical schools within UCD and Trinity College. The [[National College of Art and Design]] (NCAD) provides education and research in art, design and media. The [[National College of Ireland]] (NCI) is also based in Dublin, as well as the [[Economic and Social Research Institute]], a social science research institute, on [[Sir John Rogerson's Quay]], and the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]].

Dublin is also home to the [[Royal Irish Academy]], membership of which is considered Ireland's highest academic honour.

The [[Institute of International and European Affairs]] is also in Dublin. [[Dublin Business School]] (DBS) is Ireland's largest private third level institution with over 9,000 students located on Aungier Street, and [[Griffith College Dublin]] has its main facility in Portobello.  There are also smaller specialised colleges, including [[The Gaiety School of Acting]] and the [[New Media Technology College]].

The Irish public administration and management training centre has its base in Dublin, the Institute of Public Administration provides a range of undergraduate and post graduate awards via the National University of Ireland and in some instances, Queen's University Belfast.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Delirium''', also known as '''acute confusional state''', is an organically caused decline from a previous baseline mental functioning that develops over a short period of time, typically hours to days.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5 |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |isbn=9780890425596 |edition=Fifth |location=Arlington, VA |oclc=847226928 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delirium is a [[syndrome]] encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, such as psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleep-wake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions), although these features are not required for diagnosis.

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
Delirium is caused by an acute [[Organic brain syndrome|organic process]], which is a physically identifiable structural, functional, or chemical problem in the brain that may arise from a disease process ''outside'' the brain that nonetheless affects the brain. It may result from an underlying disease process (e.g. infection, [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]), side effect of a medication, withdrawal from drugs, over-consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], or from any number of factors affecting one's overall health (e.g. malnutrition, pain, etc.). In contrast, fluctuations in mental status/function due to changes in primarily psychiatric processes or diseases (e.g. [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]]) do not, by definition, meet the criteria for 'delirium.'

&lt;!-- Diagnosis --&gt;
Delirium may be difficult to diagnose without the proper establishment of a person's usual mental function. Without careful assessment and history, delirium can easily be confused with a number of [[psychiatric disorders]] or chronic [[organic brain syndrome]]s because of many overlapping signs and [[symptoms]] in common with [[dementia]], [[mood disorder|depression]], [[psychosis]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gleason OC | title = Delirium | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 1027–34 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12643363 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2003/0301/p1027.html | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606072937/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2003/0301/p1027.html | archive-date = 2011-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Delirium may manifest from a baseline of existing mental illness, baseline intellectual disability, or dementia, without being due to any of these problems.

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
Treatment of delirium requires treating the underlying cause and multi-faceted interventions are thought to be most effective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siddiqi2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siddiqi N, Harrison JK, Clegg A, Teale EA, Young J, Taylor J, Simpkins SA | title = Interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 3 | pages = CD005563 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26967259 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005563.pub3 | url = http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/99189/7/Siddiqi_et_al-2016-The_Cochrane_Library.pdf | doi-access = free }} [http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/99189/ Open access repository]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, temporary or symptomatic treatments are used to comfort the person or to facilitate other care (e.g. preventing people from pulling out a breathing tube).

==Definition==
In common usage, delirium is often used to refer to drowsiness, disorientation, and hallucination. In [[medical terminology]], however, acute disturbance in consciousness/attention and a number of different cognitive symptoms are the core features of delirium. Several medical definitions of delirium exist (including those in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] and [[ICD|ICD-10]]), but the core features remain the same. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association released the fifth edition of the DSM ([[DSM-5]]) with the following criteria for diagnosis:&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

* A. Disturbance in attention and awareness. This is a required symptom and involves easy distraction, inability to maintain attentional focus, and varying levels of alertness.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Psychiatric Publishing textbook of psychiatry|date=2008|editor=Hales, Robert E. |editor2=Yudofsky, Stuart C. |editor3=Gabbard, Glen O. |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |isbn=9781585622573 |edition=5th |location=Washington DC |oclc=145554590}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* B. Onset is acute (from hours to days), representing a change from baseline mentation with fluctuations throughout the day
* C. At least one additional cognitive disturbance (in memory, [[Orientation (mental)|orientation]], language, visuospatial ability, or perception)
* D. The disturbances (criteria A and C) are not better explained by another neurocognitive disorder
* E. There is evidence that the disturbances above are a &quot;direct physiological consequence&quot; of another medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, toxin, or various combinations of causes

==Signs and symptoms==
Delirium exists as a stage of consciousness somewhere in the spectrum between normal awakeness/alertness and coma. While requiring an acute disturbance in [[consciousness]]/attention and [[cognition]], delirium is a syndrome encompassing an array of neuropsychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

The range of clinical features include: poor attention/[[Vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] (100%), memory impairment (64–100%), clouding of consciousness (45–100%), disorientation (43–100%), acute onset (93%), disorganized thinking/thought disorder (59–95%), diffuse cognitive impairment (77%), language disorder (41–93%), sleep disturbance (25–96%), [[Emotional lability|mood lability]] (43–63%), psychomotor changes (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed) (38–55%), delusions (18–68%), and perceptual change/hallucinations (17–55%).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; These various features of delirium are further described below:

* '''Inattention''': As a required symptom to diagnose delirium, this is characterized by distractibility and an inability to shift and/or sustain [[attention]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* '''Memory impairment''': [[Memory impairment]] is linked to inattention, especially reduced formation of new ''long-term'' memory where higher degrees of attention is more necessary than for short-term memory. Since older memories are retained without need of concentration, previously formed long-term memories (i.e. those formed before the onset of delirium) are usually preserved in all but the most severe cases of delirium.
* '''Disorientation:''' As another symptom of confusion, and usually a more severe one, this describes the loss of awareness of the surroundings, environment and context in which the person exists. One may be disoriented to time, place, or self.
* '''Disorganized thinking''': [[Thought disorder|Disorganized thinking]] is usually noticed with speech that makes limited sense with apparent irrelevancies, and can involve [[Alogia|poverty of speech]], [[Derailment (thought disorder)|loose associations]], [[perseveration]], [[Tangential speech|tangentiality]], and other signs of a formal thought disorder.
*'''Language disturbances''': [[Anomic aphasia]], [[paraphasia]], impaired comprehension, [[agraphia]], and word-finding difficulties all involve impairment of linguistic information processing.
*'''Sleep changes''': Sleep disturbances in delirium reflect disturbed circadian rhythm regulation, typically involving fragmented sleep or even sleep-wake cycle reversal (i.e. active at night, sleeping during the day) and often preceding the onset of a delirium episode
*'''Psychotic symptoms:''' Symptoms of [[psychosis]] include suspiciousness, overvalued ideation and frank delusions. [[Delusions]] are typically poorly formed and less [[Stereotypy|stereotyped]] than in schizophrenia or Alzheimer’s disease. They usually relate to persecutory themes of impending danger or threat in the immediate environment (e.g. being poisoned by nurses).

==Causes==

Delirium arises through the interaction of a number of predisposing and precipitating factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Magny E, Le Petitcorps H, Pociumban M, Bouksani-Kacher Z, Pautas É, Belmin J, Bastuji-Garin S, Lafuente-Lafuente C | display-authors = 6 | title = Predisposing and precipitating factors for delirium in community-dwelling older adults admitted to hospital with this condition: A prospective case series | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = e0193034 | date = 2018-02-23 | pmid = 29474380 | pmc = 5825033 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0193034 | bibcode = 2018PLoSO..1393034M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with multiple and/or significant predisposing factors are highly at risk for suffering an episode of delirium with a single and/or mild precipitating factor. Conversely, delirium may only result in  healthy individuals if they suffer serious or multiple precipitating factors. It is important to note that the factors affecting those of an individual can change over time, thus an individual’s risk of delirium is dynamic.

===Predisposing factors===

===Precipitating factors===
[[File:An alcoholic man with delirium Wellcome L0060780 (level correction).jpg|thumb|Acute confusional state caused by alcohol withdrawal, also known as [[delirium tremens]]]]
Any acute factors that affect neurotransmitter, neuroendocrine, or neuroinflammatory pathways can precipitate an episode of delirium in a vulnerable brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes CG, Patel MB, Pandharipande PP | title = Pathophysiology of acute brain dysfunction: what's the cause of all this confusion? | journal = Current Opinion in Critical Care | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 518–26 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22941208 | doi = 10.1097/MCC.0b013e328357effa }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical environments can also precipitate delirium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCusker J, Cole M, Abrahamowicz M, Han L, Podoba JE, Ramman-Haddad L | title = Environmental risk factors for delirium in hospitalized older people | journal = Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume = 49 | issue = 10 | pages = 1327–34 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11890491 | doi = 10.1046/j.1532-5415.2001.49260.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most common precipitating factors are listed below:&lt;ref name=&quot;Inouye2006&quot; /&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of delirium is still not well understood, despite extensive research.

===Animal models===
The lack of animal models that are relevant to delirium has left many key questions in delirium pathophysiology unanswered. Earliest rodent models of delirium used [[atropine]] (a [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]] blocker) to induce cognitive and electroencephalography (EEG) changes similar to delirium, and other [[anticholinergic]] drugs, such as [[biperiden]] and [[hyoscine]], have produced similar effects. Along with clinical studies using various drugs with anticholinergic activity, these models have contributed to a &quot;cholinergic deficiency hypothesis&quot; of delirium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hshieh TT, Fong TG, Marcantonio ER, Inouye SK | title = Cholinergic deficiency hypothesis in delirium: a synthesis of current evidence | journal = The Journals of Gerontology. Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences | volume = 63 | issue = 7 | pages = 764–72 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18693233 | pmc = 2917793 | doi = 10.1093/gerona/63.7.764 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Profound systemic inflammation occurring during [[sepsis]] is also known to cause delirium (often termed sepsis-associated encephalopathy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zampieri FG, Park M, Machado FS, Azevedo LC | title = Sepsis-associated encephalopathy: not just delirium | journal = Clinics | volume = 66 | issue = 10 | pages = 1825–31 | date = 2011 | pmid = 22012058 | pmc = 3180153 | doi = 10.1590/S1807-59322011001000024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal models used to study the interactions between prior degenerative disease and overlying systemic inflammation have shown that even mild systemic inflammation causes acute and transient deficits in working memory among diseased animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunningham 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cunningham C, Maclullich AM | title = At the extreme end of the psychoneuroimmunological spectrum: delirium as a maladaptive sickness behaviour response | journal = Brain, Behavior, and Immunity | volume = 28 | pages = 1–13 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 22884900 | pmc = 4157329 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbi.2012.07.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior [[dementia]] or age-associated cognitive impairment is the primary predisposing factor for clinical delirium and &quot;prior pathology&quot; as defined by these new animal models may consist of synaptic loss, abnormal network connectivity, and &quot;primed [[microglia]]&quot; brain macrophages stimulated by prior neurodegenerative disease and aging to amplify subsequent inflammatory responses in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunningham 2012&quot; /&gt;

===Cerebrospinal fluid===
Studies of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in delirium are difficult to perform. Apart from the general difficulty of recruiting participants who are often unable to give consent, the inherently invasive nature of CSF sampling makes such research particularly challenging. However, a few studies have exploited the opportunity to sample CSF from persons undergoing spinal anesthesia for elective or emergency surgery.

A 2018 [[systematic review]] showed that, broadly, delirium may be associated with neurotransmitter imbalance (namely serotonin and dopamine signaling), reversible fall in somatostatin, and increased cortisol.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall RJ, Watne LO, Cunningham E, Zetterberg H, Shenkin SD, Wyller TB, MacLullich AM | title = CSF biomarkers in delirium: a systematic review | journal = International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry | volume = 33 | issue = 11 | pages = 1479–1500 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 28585290 | doi = 10.1002/gps.4720 | url = http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10060989/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading &quot;neuroinflammatory hypothesis&quot; (where neurodegenerative disease and aging leads the brain to respond to peripheral inflammation with an exaggerated CNS inflammatory response) has been described,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cerejeira J, Firmino H, Vaz-Serra A, Mukaetova-Ladinska EB | title = The neuroinflammatory hypothesis of delirium | journal = Acta Neuropathologica | volume = 119 | issue = 6 | pages = 737–54 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20309566 | doi = 10.1007/s00401-010-0674-1 | hdl = 10400.4/806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but current evidence is still conflicting and fails to concretely support this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

===Neuroimaging===
[[Neuroimaging]] provides an important avenue to explore the mechanisms that are responsible for delirium.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nitchingham|first=Anita|last2=Kumar|first2=Varun|last3=Shenkin|first3=Susan|last4=Ferguson|first4=Karen J.|last5=Caplan|first5=Gideon A.|date=2018|title=A systematic review of neuroimaging in delirium: predictors, correlates and consequences: Neuroimaging in delirium|journal=International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry|volume=33|issue=11|pages=1458–1478|doi=10.1002/gps.4724|pmid=28574155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soiza|first=Roy L.|last2=Sharma|first2=Vijay|last3=Ferguson|first3=Karen|last4=Shenkin|first4=Susan D.|last5=Seymour|first5=David Gwyn|last6=MacLullich|first6=Alasdair M.J.|date=September 2008|title=Neuroimaging studies of delirium: A systematic review|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|volume=65|issue=3|pages=239–248|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2008.05.021|pmid=18707946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite progress in the development of [[Magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]], the large variety in imaging-based findings has limited our understanding of the changes in the brain that may be linked to delirium. Some challenges associated with imaging people diagnosed with delirium include participant recruitment and inadequate consideration of important confounding factors such as history of [[dementia]] and/or [[Depression (mood)|depression]], which are known to be associated with overlapping changes in the brain also observed on [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;

Evidence for changes in structural and functional markers include: changes in [[White matter|white-matter]] integrity (white matter lesions), decreases in brain volume (likely as a result of tissue [[atrophy]]), abnormal [[Resting state fMRI|functional connectivity]] of brain regions responsible for normal processing of executive function, sensory processing, attention, emotional regulation, memory, and orientation, differences in autoregulation of the vascular vessels in the brain, reduction in cerebral blood flow and possible changes in brain metabolism (including cerebral tissue oxygenation and glucose hypometabolism).&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt; Altogether, these changes in [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]-based measurements invite further investigation of the mechanisms that may underlie delirium, as a potential avenue to improve clinical management of people suffering with this condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;

===Neurophysiology===
[[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) allows for continuous capture of global brain function and brain connectivity, and is useful in understanding real-time physiologic changes during delirium.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shafi MM, Santarnecchi E, Fong TG, Jones RN, Marcantonio ER, Pascual-Leone A, Inouye SK | title = Advancing the Neurophysiological Understanding of Delirium | journal = Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume = 65 | issue = 6 | pages = 1114–1118 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28165616 | pmc = 5576199 | doi = 10.1111/jgs.14748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s, delirium has been known to be associated with slowing of resting-state EEG rhythms, with abnormally decreased background alpha power and increased theta and delta frequency activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Engel GL, Romano J | title = Delirium, a syndrome of cerebral insufficiency. 1959 | journal = The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 526–38 | date = Fall 2004 | pmid = 15616182 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.16.4.526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From such evidence, a 2018 systematic review proposed a conceptual model that delirium results when insults/stressors trigger a breakdown of brain network dynamics in individuals with low brain resilience (i.e. people who already have underlying problems of low neural connectivity and/or low [[neuroplasticity]] like those with Alzheimers disease).&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

===Neuropathology===
Only a handful of studies exist where there has been an attempt to correlate delirium with pathological findings at autopsy. One research study has been reported on 7 patients who died during ICU admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Janz DR, Abel TW, Jackson JC, Gunther ML, Heckers S, Ely EW | title = Brain autopsy findings in intensive care unit patients previously suffering from delirium: a pilot study | journal = Journal of Critical Care | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 538.e7–12 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20580199 | pmc = 3755870 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcrc.2010.05.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each case was admitted with a range of primary pathologies, but all had [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] and/or [[septic shock]] contributing to the delirium, 6 showed evidence of low brain perfusion and diffuse vascular injury, and 5 showed [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] involvement. A case-control study showed that 9 delirium cases showed higher expression of [[HLA-DR]] and [[CD68]] (markers of microglial activation), IL-6 (cytokines pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities) and GFAP (marker of [[astrocyte]] activity) than age-matched controls; this supports a neuroinflammatory cause to delirium, but the conclusions are limited by methodological issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Munster BC, Aronica E, Zwinderman AH, Eikelenboom P, Cunningham C, Rooij SE | title = Neuroinflammation in delirium: a postmortem case-control study | journal = Rejuvenation Research | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 615–22 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 21978081 | pmc = 4309948 | doi = 10.1089/rej.2011.1185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 retrospective study correlating autopsy data with [[Mini–Mental State Examination|MMSE]] scores from 987 brain donors found that delirium combined with a pathological process of dementia accelerated MMSE score decline more than either individual process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davis DH, Muniz-Terrera G, Keage HA, Stephan BC, Fleming J, Ince PG, Matthews FE, Cunningham C, Ely EW, MacLullich AM, Brayne C | display-authors = 6 | title = Association of Delirium With Cognitive Decline in Late Life: A Neuropathologic Study of 3 Population-Based Cohort Studies | journal = JAMA Psychiatry | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–251 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28114436 | pmc = 6037291 | doi = 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.3423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Using the DSM-V criteria for delirium as framework, the early recognition of signs/symptoms and a careful history, along with any of multiple clinical instruments, can help in making a diagnosis of delirium. A diagnosis of delirium ''cannot'' be made without a previous assessment of the patient's ''baseline'' level of [[cognitive function]]. In other words, a mentally-disabled or demented person might appear to be delirious, but may actually just be operating at his/her baseline mental ability.

=== General setting ===
Multiple guidelines recommend that delirium should be diagnosed when it presents to healthcare services. Much evidence reveal, however, that delirium is greatly under-diagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bellelli G, Nobili A, Annoni G, Morandi A, Djade CD, Meagher DJ, Maclullich AM, Davis D, Mazzone A, Tettamanti M, Mannucci PM | display-authors = 6 | title = Under-detection of delirium and impact of neurocognitive deficits on in-hospital mortality among acute geriatric and medical wards | journal = European Journal of Internal Medicine | volume = 26 | issue = 9 | pages = 696–704 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26333532 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejim.2015.08.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCoy TH, Snapper L, Stern TA, Perlis RH | title = Underreporting of Delirium in Statewide Claims Data: Implications for Clinical Care and Predictive Modeling | journal = Psychosomatics | volume = 57 | issue = 5 | pages = 480–8 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27480944 | doi = 10.1016/j.psym.2016.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher rates of detection of delirium in general settings can be assisted by the use of validated delirium screening tools.

*'''Dementia''': This group of disorders is acquired (non-congenital) with usually irreversible cognitive and psychosocial functional decline. [[Dementia]] usually results from an identifiable degenerative brain disease (e.g. [[Alzheimer disease]] or [[Huntington's disease]]), requires chronic impairment (versus acute onset in delirium), and is typically not associated with changes in level of consciousness.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}
*'''Depression''': Similar symptoms exist between [[clinical depression|depression]] and delirium (especially the hypoactive subtype). Gathering a history from other caregivers can clarify baseline mentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Sullivan R, Inouye SK, Meagher D | title = Delirium and depression: inter-relationship and clinical overlap in elderly people | journal = The Lancet.

*'''Other mental illnesses''': Some mental illnesses, such as a manic episode of bipolar disorder, [[depersonalization disorder]], or some types of acute psychosis may cause a rapidly fluctuating impairment of cognitive function and ability to focus. These, however, are not technically causes of delirium per DSM-V criteria D (i.e. fluctuating cognitive symptoms occurring as part of a ''primary'' ''mental'' disorder are results of the said mental disorder itself), while ''physical'' disorders (e.g. infections, hypoxia, etc.) can precipitate delirium as a mental side-effect/symptom.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}
*'''Psychosis''': Consciousness and cognition may not be impaired (however, there may be overlap, as some acute [[psychosis]], especially with mania, is capable of producing delirium-like states).{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

The authors of this review were uncertain whether maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) or with inhalational agents can affect incidences of postoperative delirium.

==Treatment==
Treatment of delirium involves two main strategies: 1. identify and treat the underlying medical disorder or cause(s), and 2. manage behavioral disturbances. This involves optimizing oxygenation, hydration, nutrition, electrolytes/metabolites, comfort, mobilization, pain control, mental stress, therapeutic medication levels, and addressing any other possible predisposing and precipitating factors that might be disrupting brain function.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inouye2006&quot; /&gt;

===Non-pharmacologic interventions===

These interventions are the first steps in managing acute delirium and there are many overlaps with delirium preventative strategies.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; In addition to treating immediate life-threatening causes of delirium (e.g. low O2, low blood pressure, low glucose, dehydration), interventions include optimizing the hospital environment by reducing ambient noise, providing proper lighting, offering pain relief, promoting healthy sleep-wake cycles, and minimizing room changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Risk reduction and management of delirium : a national clinical guideline.|others=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network., Scotland. Healthcare Improvement Scotland.|isbn=9781909103689|location=Edinburgh|oclc=1099827664|year = 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although multicomponent care and comprehensive geriatric care are more specialized for a person experiencing delirium, several studies have been unable to find evidence showing they reduce the duration of delirium.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;

Family, friends, and other caregivers can offer frequent reassurance, tactile and verbal orientation, cognitive stimulation (e.g. regular visits, familiar objects, clocks, calendars, etc.), and means to stay engaged (e.g. making hearing aids and eyeglasses readily available).&lt;ref name=&quot;Inouye2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NICE&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rudolph JL, Marcantonio ER | title = Review articles: postoperative delirium: acute change with long-term implications | journal = Anesthesia and Analgesia | volume = 112 | issue = 5 | pages = 1202–11 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21474660 | pmc = 3090222 | doi = 10.1213/ANE.0b013e3182147f6d }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes verbal and non-verbal deescalation techniques may be required to offer reassurances and calm the person experiencing delirium.&lt;ref name=&quot;NICE&quot; /&gt; Restraints should rarely be used as an intervention for delirium.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt; The use of restraints has been recognized as a risk factor for injury and aggravating symptoms, especially in older hospitalized people with delirium.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt; The only cases where restraints should sparingly be used during delirium is in the protection of life-sustaining interventions, such as endotracheal tubes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=DeWitt|first=Marie A.|title=Delirium|date=2018-07-06|work=The American Psychiatric Association Publishing Textbook of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|publisher=American Psychiatric Association Publishing|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9781615372423.sy08|isbn=978-1-61537-187-7|last2=Tune|first2=Larry E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approached called the &quot;T-A-DA (''tolerate, anticipate, don't agitate'') method&quot; can be an effective management technique for older people with delirium, where abnormal patient behaviors (including hallucinations and delusions) are tolerated and unchallenged, as long as caregiver and patient safety is not threatened.&lt;ref name=&quot;oh&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Oh ES, Fong TG, Hshieh TT, Inouye SK|date=September 2017|title=Delirium in Older Persons: Advances in Diagnosis and Treatment|journal=JAMA|volume=318|issue=12|pages=1161–1174|doi=10.1001/jama.2017.12067|pmc=5717753|pmid=28973626}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of this model may require a designated area in the hospital.

The antidepressant [[trazodone]] is occasionally used in the treatment of delirium, but it carries a risk of over-sedation, and its use has not been well studied.&lt;ref name=Inouye2006/&gt;

==Prognosis==
There is substantial evidence that delirium results in long-term poor outcomes in older persons admitted to hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Witlox&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Witlox J, Eurelings LS, de Jonghe JF, Kalisvaart KJ, Eikelenboom P, van Gool WA | title = Delirium in elderly patients and the risk of postdischarge mortality, institutionalization, and dementia: a meta-analysis | journal = JAMA | volume = 304 | issue = 4 | pages = 443–51 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20664045 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.1013 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/84babc901e0829a5a981c2b112cd85d02fd35376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This systematic review only included studies that looked for an independent effect of delirium (i.e., after accounting for other associations with poor outcomes, for example co-morbidity or illness severity).

In older persons admitted to hospital, individuals experiencing delirium are twice as likely to die than those who do not (meta-analysis of 12 studies).&lt;ref name=&quot;Witlox&quot; /&gt; In the only prospective study conducted in the general population, older persons reporting delirium also showed higher mortality (60% increase).&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davis DH, Muniz Terrera G, Keage H, Rahkonen T, Oinas M, Matthews FE, Cunningham C, Polvikoski T, Sulkava R, MacLullich AM, Brayne C | display-authors = 6 | title = Delirium is a strong risk factor for dementia in the oldest-old: a population-based cohort study | journal = Brain | volume = 135 | issue = Pt 9 | pages = 2809–16 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22879644 | pmc = 3437024 | doi = 10.1093/brain/aws190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutionalization was also twice as likely after an admission with delirium (meta-analysis of 7 studies).&lt;ref name=&quot;Witlox&quot; /&gt; In a community-based population examining individuals after an episode of severe infection (though not specifically delirium), these persons acquired more functional limitations (i.e. required more assistance with their care needs) than those not experiencing infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwashyna TJ, Ely EW, Smith DM, Langa KM | title = Long-term cognitive impairment and functional disability among survivors of severe sepsis | journal = JAMA | volume = 304 | issue = 16 | pages = 1787–94 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20978258 | pmc = 3345288 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.1553 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After an episode of delirium in the general population, functional dependence increased threefold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot; /&gt;

===Dementia in ICU survivors===
Dementia is supposed to be an entity that continues to decline, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Another way of looking at dementia, however, is not strictly based on the decline component, but on the degree of memory and executive function problems. It is now known, for example, that between 50% and 70% of ICU patients have tremendous problems with ongoing brain dysfunction similar to those experienced by Alzheimer’s or TBI (traumatic brain injury) patients, leaving many ICU survivors permanently disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hopkins RO, Jackson JC | title = Long-term neurocognitive function after critical illness | journal = Chest | volume = 130 | issue = 3 | pages = 869–78 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16963688 | doi = 10.1378/chest.130.3.869 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6d188720b9ec7d8f643d44a3e26f66c3dddaf233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a distressing personal and public health problem and is getting an increasing amount of scrutiny in ongoing investigations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

The implications of such an &quot;acquired dementia-like illness&quot; can profoundly debilitate a person's livelihood level, often dismantling his/her life in practical ways like impairing one's ability to find a car in a parking lot, complete shopping lists, or perform job-related tasks done previously for years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} The societal implications can be enormous when considering work-force issues related to the inability of wage-earners to work due to their own ICU stay or that of someone else they must care for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/10/10/654445929/when-icu-delirium-leads-to-symptoms-of-dementia-after-discharge |title=When ICU Delirium Leads To Symptoms Of Dementia After Discharge |last=Harris |first=Richard |publisher=National Public Radio |date=October 10, 2018 |access-date=29 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
The highest rates of delirium (often 50% to 75% of people) is seen among those who are critically ill in the intensive care unit (ICU)&lt;ref name=&quot;icudelirium&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icudelirium.org|title=ICU Delirium and Cognitive Impairment Study Group|publisher=Vanderbilt University Medical Center|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010082059/http://www.icudelirium.org/|archive-date=10 October 2013|url-status=live|access-date=6 December 2012|display-authors=etal|vauthors=Ely EW}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, this was referred to as &quot;ICU psychosis&quot; or &quot;ICU syndrome&quot;, terms largely abandoned for the more widely accepted term ICU delirium. Since the advent of validated and easy-to-implement delirium instruments for ICU patients such as the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU)&lt;ref name=Ely2001/&gt; and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checkllist (IC-DSC).,&lt;ref name=Bergeron2001/&gt;  of the hundreds of thousands of ICU patients who develop delirium in ICUs every year, it has been recognized that most of them belong to the hypoactive variety, which is easily missed and invisible to the managing teams unless actively monitored using such instruments. The causes of delirium in such patients depend on the underlying illnesses, new problems like [[sepsis]] and low oxygen levels, and the sedative and pain medicines that are nearly universally given to all ICU patients.  Outside the ICU, on hospital wards and in nursing homes, the problem of delirium is also a very important medical problem, especially for older patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ryan DJ, O'Regan NA, Caoimh RÓ, Clare J, O'Connor M, Leonard M, McFarland J, Tighe S, O'Sullivan K, Trzepacz PT, Meagher D, Timmons S | display-authors = 6 | title = Delirium in an adult acute hospital population: predictors, prevalence and detection | journal = BMJ Open | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = e001772 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23299110 | pmc = 3549230 | doi = 10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Democles''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Δημοκλῆς}}; fl. 4th century BC) was an [[Athens|Athenian]] [[orator]], and a contemporary of [[Demochares]], among whose opponents he is mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harpocration]], ''Lexicon of the Ten Orators'', s.v. &quot;ho to hieron pyr&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was a disciple of [[Theophrastus]], and is chiefly known as the defender of the children of [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]] against the [[Calumny|calumnies]] of [[Moerocles]] and [[Menesaechmus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Plutarch]], ''[[Moralia]]'', &quot;Lives of the Ten Orators&quot;, [http://www.attalus.org/old/orators1.html#842 p. 842]&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that in the time of [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], some orations of Democles were still extant, since that critic attributes to him an oration, which went by the name of [[Dinarchus]].&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius, ''Dinarchus'', 10&lt;/ref&gt; It must be observed that Dionysius and the ''[[Suda]]'' call this orator by the patronymic form of his name, Democleides, so he may be the same person called Democleides who was [[eponymous archon]] in 316 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Bibliotheca'', xix. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote a treatise on machinery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitruvius]] vii, introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Donald John Trump''' (born June 14, 1946) is the [[List of presidents of the United States#Presidents|45th]] and current [[president of the United States]]. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality.&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE the first paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 17. --&gt;

Trump was born and raised in the New York City borough of [[Queens]], and received a [[bachelor's degree]] in economics from the [[Wharton School]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He took charge of his family's real-estate business in 1971, renamed it [[The Trump Organization]], and expanded its operations from Queens and [[Brooklyn]] into [[Manhattan]]. The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started [[The Trump Organization#Other ventures and investments|various side ventures]], mostly by licensing his name. He owned the [[Miss Universe]] and [[Miss USA]] beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015, and produced and hosted ''[[The Apprentice (American TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', a [[reality television]] show, from 2003 to 2015.

Trump entered the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential race]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and defeated 16 other candidates in the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|primaries]]. [[Political positions of Donald Trump|His political positions]] have been described as [[populist]], [[protectionist]], and [[nationalist]].

Consequently, it is possible for the [[president-elect]] to have received fewer votes from the country's total population (the popular vote).

He appointed [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In foreign policy, Trump has pursued an [[America First (policy)|America First]] agenda, withdrawing the U.S. from the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] trade negotiations, the [[Paris Agreement]] on climate change, and the [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear deal]].

A [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|special counsel investigation]] led by [[Robert Mueller]] [[Mueller Report|found]] that Trump and [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|his campaign]] welcomed and encouraged [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian foreign interference]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] under the belief that it would be politically advantageous, but did not find sufficient evidence to press charges of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|criminal conspiracy]] or coordination{{efn|name=coordination|&quot;In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign 'coordinat[ed]'{{snd}}a term that appears in the appointment order{{snd}}with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, 'coordination' does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement{{snd}}tacit or express{{snd}}between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference.

=== Side ventures ===

After taking over control of the Trump Organization in 1971, Trump expanded its real estate operations and ventured into other business activities. The company eventually became the umbrella organization for several hundred individual business ventures and partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33644498 |title=Five take-aways from Donald Trump's financial disclosure |work=[[BBC Online]] |date=July 23, 2015 |accessdate=January 17, 2016 |first=Anthony |last=Zurcher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jk-8-7-15&quot;/&gt;

In September 1983, Trump purchased the [[New Jersey Generals]]{{snd}}an American football team that played in the [[United States Football League]]. After the 1985 season, the league folded largely due to Trump's strategy of moving games to a fall schedule where they competed with the [[NFL]] for audience, and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust lawsuit against the organization.&lt;ref name=Markazi&gt;{{cite news |first=Arash |last=Markazi |authorlink=Arash Markazi |title=5 things to know about Donald Trump's foray into doomed USFL |date=July 14, 2015 |website=[[ESPN]] |url=https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/13255737/five-things-know-donald-trump-usfl-experience}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;{{cite news |url=https://fortune.com/2017/09/24/donald-trump-nfl-usfl/ |title=Donald Trump Fought the NFL Once Before.

Trump purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies during the late 1980s, as Wall Street saw a wave of corporate acquisitions known as [[leveraged buyouts]]. In some cases, these acquisitions were [[Takeover#Hostile|hostile takeovers]] conducted by so-called [[corporate raider|corporate raiders]]. Some raiders purchased a stake in a public company with the stated but feigned intent of acquiring it, then pressured management to repurchase the stake at a profitable premium for the raider — a practice known as [[greenmail]]. Some observers believed Trump was engaged in such practices, though he denied it. Analysis conducted by ''The New York Times'' found that Trump made millions of dollars in these stock transactions, but &quot;lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html |title=Decade in the Red: Trump Tax Figures Show Over $1 Billion in Business Losses |first1=Russ |last1=Buettner |first2=Susanne |last2=Craig |date=May 8, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/06/business/american-air-gets-trump-bid-of-7.5-billion.html |title=American Air Gets Trump Bid Of $7.5 Billion |first=Agis |last=Salpukas |date=October 6, 1989 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/23/nyregion/trump-ends-his-struggle-to-gain-control-of-bally.html |title=Trump Ends His Struggle to Gain Control of Bally |first=Donald |last=Janson |date=February 23, 1987 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Trump founded [[Trump Shuttle]], purchasing 21 planes and landing rights at three airports in New York City, Boston, and the Washington, D.C., area, from the defunct [[Eastern Air Lines]], costing $380&amp;nbsp;million financed from 22 banks. The airline offered charter services in addition to scheduled shuttle flights, and was eventually sold to [[USAir Group]] in 1992 after failing to operate at a profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;plane_rumour&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Kessler |first=Glenn |authorlink=Glenn Kessler (journalist) |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/11/too-good-to-check-sean-hannitys-tale-of-a-trump-rescue/ |title=Too good to check: Sean Hannity's tale of a Trump rescue |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=March 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Trump spent $94,801 ({{Inflation|US|94,801|1987|fmt=eq}}) to place full-page advertisements in three major newspapers, proclaiming &quot;America should stop paying to defend countries that can afford to defend themselves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/02/nyregion/trump-gives-a-vague-hint-of-candidacy.html |title=Trump Gives a Vague Hint of Candidacy |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Michael |last=Oreskes |authorlink=Michael Oreskes |date=September 2, 1987 |accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisements also advocated for &quot;reducing the budget deficit, working for peace in Central America, and speeding up nuclear disarmament negotiations with the [[Soviet Union]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;democrat.gala&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/18/us/trump-urged-to-head-gala-of-democrats.html |title=Trump Urged To Head Gala Of Democrats |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 18, 1987 |first=Fox |last=Butterfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; After rumors of a presidential run, Trump was invited by then U.S. senator [[John Kerry]] (Democrat from Massachusetts), [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House speaker]] [[Jim Wright]] of Texas, and Arkansas congressman [[Beryl Anthony Jr.]] to host a fundraising dinner for Democratic congressional candidates and to switch parties. Anthony told ''The New York Times'' that &quot;the message Trump has been preaching is a Democratic message.&quot; Asked whether the rumors were true, Trump denied being a candidate, but said, &quot;I believe that if I did run for President, I'd win.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;democrat.gala&quot; /&gt; According to a [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll in December 1988, Trump was the tenth most admired man in America.{{sfn|Kranish|Fisher|2017|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=x2jUDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}{{sfn|Gallup|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=G7Tf_1GzlHEC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}

Trump publicly speculated about running for president in [[2012 United States presidential election|the 2012 election]], and made his first speaking appearance at the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC) in February 2011. The speech is credited for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.towleroad.com/2011/02/goproud-leads-trump-in-2012-movement-at-cpac/ |title=GOProud Leads 'Trump in 2012' Movement at CPAC |website=[[Towleroad.com]] |date=February 10, 2011 |last=Belonsky |first=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, according to Evan Jones, the headmaster of the New York Military Academy at the time, the then-superintendent Jeffrey Coverdale had demanded Trump's academic records, to hand them over to &quot;prominent, wealthy alumni of the school who were Mr. Trump's friends&quot; at their request. Coverdale said he had refused to hand over Trump's records to trustees of the school, and instead sealed Trump's records on campus. Jones stated: &quot;It was the only time in my education career that I ever heard of someone's record being removed,&quot; while Coverdale further said: &quot;It's the only time I ever moved an alumnus's records.&quot; The incident reportedly happened days after Trump demanded President Barack Obama's academic records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 5, 2019 |last1=Fisher |first1=Marc |authorlink=Marc Fisher |title='Grab that record': How Trump's high school transcript was hidden |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/grab-that-record-how-trumps-high-school-transcript-was-hidden/2019/03/05/8815b7b8-3c61-11e9-aaae-69364b2ed137_story.html |website=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=June 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== General election campaign ====

After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump shifted his focus to the [[2016 United States presidential election|general election]]. Trump began campaigning against Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016.

Clinton had established a significant lead over Trump in [[Nationwide opinion polling for the United States presidential election, 2016|national polls]] throughout most of 2016. In early July, Clinton's lead narrowed in national polling averages following the FBI's re-opening of its investigation into her ongoing [[Hillary Clinton email controversy|email controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/amp/poll-clinton-trump-now-tied-gop-convention-kicks-n611936 |title=Poll: Clinton and Trump Now Tied as GOP Convention Kicks Off |last1=Hartig |first1=Hannah |last2=Lapinski |first2=John |last3=Psyllos |first3=Stephanie |date=July 19, 2016 |website=[[NBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton |title=2016 General Election: Trump vs. Clinton |accessdate=October 3, 2016 |website=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html |title=General Election: Trump vs. Clinton |accessdate=October 3, 2016 |website=RealClearPolitics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a presidential candidate, Trump disclosed details of his companies, assets, and revenue sources to the extent required by the FEC.

In October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from ''The New York Times''. They show that Trump declared a loss of $916&amp;nbsp;million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years. During the second presidential debate, Trump acknowledged using the deduction, but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-20161010&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html |title=Donald Trump Acknowledges Not Paying Federal Income Taxes for Years |last1=Eder |first1=Steve |last2=Twohey |first2=Megan |author2link=Megan Twohey |date=October 10, 2016 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 14, 2017, the first two pages of Trump's 2005 federal income tax returns were leaked to [[MSNBC]].

On November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 pledged [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] versus 232 for Clinton. The official counts were 304 and 227 respectively, after [[Faithless electors in the United States presidential election, 2016|defections on both sides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Kiersten |last1=Schmidt |first2=Wilson |last2=Andrews |title=A Historic Number of Electors Defected, and Most Were Supposed to Vote for Clinton |date=December 19, 2016 |accessdate=January 31, 2017 |website=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/19/us/elections/electoral-college-results.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump received nearly 2.9 million fewer popular votes than Clinton, which made him the fifth person to be elected president [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|while losing the popular vote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Desilver |first=Drew |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/12/20/why-electoral-college-landslides-are-easier-to-win-than-popular-vote-ones/ |title=Trump's victory another example of how Electoral College wins are bigger than popular vote ones |website=[[Pew Research Center]] |date=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Records on this matter date from the year 1824.

Despite their similarities, some of these five elections had peculiar results; e.g. [[John Quincy Adams]] trailed in ''both'' the national popular vote and the electoral college in 1824 (since no one had a majority in the electoral college, Adams was chosen by the House of Representatives), and [[Samuel Tilden]] in 1876 remains the only losing candidate to win an actual majority of the popular vote (rather than just a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=G.

The economic expansion that began in June 2009 continued through Trump's first three years in office. Throughout his presidency, he has repeatedly and falsely characterized the economy as the best in American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/07/president-trumps-repeated-claim-greatest-economy-history-our-country/ |title=President Trump's repeated claim: 'The greatest economy in the history of our country' |last=Kessler |first=Glenn |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 7, 2018 |accessdate=May 27, 2019 |authorlink=Glenn Kessler (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, Trump signed the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], which cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, lowered personal tax brackets, increased child tax credit, doubled the [[Estate tax in the United States|estate tax]] exemption to $11.2&amp;nbsp;million, and limited the state and local tax deduction to $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/15/us/politics/final-republican-tax-bill-cuts.html |title=What's in the Final Republican Tax Bill |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first1=Wilson |last1=Andrews |first2=Alicia |last2=Parlapiano |date=December 15, 2017 |accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Donald Trump in Ypsilanti (33998674940) (cropped2).jpg|thumb|Trump speaking to automobile workers in Michigan, March 2017]]

Trump is a skeptic of multilateral trade deals, as he believes they indirectly incentivize unfair trade practices that then tend to go unpoliced. He favors bilateral trade deals, as they allow one party to pull out if the other party is believed to be behaving unfairly. Trump favors neutral or positive balances of trade over negative balances of trade, also known as a &quot;trade deficit&quot;. Trump adopted his current skeptical views toward trade liberalization in the 1980s, and he sharply criticized [[NAFTA]] during the Republican primary campaign in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schlesinger |first=Jacob M. |title=Trump Forged His Ideas on Trade in the 1980s – And Never Deviated |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-forged-his-ideas-on-trade-in-the-1980sand-never-deviated-1542304508 |date=November 15, 2018 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=November 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-lays-out-protectionist-views-in-trade-speech-1467145538 |title=Donald Trump Lays Out Protectionist Views in Trade Speech |last=Epstein |first=Reid J. |date=June 28, 2016 |last2=Nelson |first2=Colleen McCain |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] {{subscription required}} |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-calls-nafta-a-disaster/ |title=Trump calls NAFTA a &quot;disaster&quot; |date=September 25, 2015 |website=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He withdrew the U.S. from the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (TPP) negotiations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/politics/trump-tpp-things-to-know/index.html |title=Trump's TPP withdrawal: 5 things to know |last=Bradner |first=Eric |date=January 23, 2017 |website=[[CNN]] |accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,&lt;ref name=Inman&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/10/war-over-steel-trump-tips-global-trade-turmoil-tariffs |title=The war over steel: Trump tips global trade into new turmoil |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=March 10, 2018 |accessdate=March 15, 2018 |last=Inman |first=Phillip}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched a [[China–United States trade war|trade war]] with China by sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50&amp;nbsp;billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/07/donald-trump-says-he-favors-big-tariffs-on-chinese-exports/ |title=Donald Trump Says He Favors Big Tariffs on Chinese Exports |last=Haberman |first=Maggie |authorlink=Maggie Haberman |date=January 7, 2016 |website=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-ministry/trump-sets-tariffs-on-50-billion-in-chinese-goods-beijing-strikes-back-idUSKBN1JB0KC |title=Trump sets tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods; Beijing strikes |date=June 16, 2018 |work=[[Reuters]] |first1=David |last1=Lawder |first2=Ben |last2=Blanchard}}&lt;/ref&gt; On several occasions, Trump has said incorrectly that these import tariffs are paid by China into the [[U.S. Treasury]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Newburger-190512&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/12/kudlow-says-us-will-pay-for-china-tariffs-contradicting-trump.html |title=Kudlow acknowledges US will pay for China tariffs, contradicting Trump |website=[[CNBC]] |date=May 12, 2019 |accessdate=May 20, 2019 |first=Emma |last=Newburger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impeachment inquiry came in the wake of a [[Whistleblower protection in the United States|whistleblower]] complaint alleging abuse of power involving the Trump-Zelensky call, as well as other allegations: that the White House attempted to &quot;lock down&quot; the call records in a [[cover-up]], and that the call was part of a wider pressure campaign by Giuliani and the Trump administration to urge Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.

Among several State Department employees testifying to congressional committees in October 2019, [[William B.

As part of the impeachment inquiry, the House Judiciary Committee asked to see secret grand jury information which had been used in compiling the Mueller Report. The [[Department of Justice]] (DOJ) refused to turn it over, arguing that secrecy of grand jury material must be preserved and that the impeachment inquiry was invalid.
